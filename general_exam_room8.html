    const questions = [
    { q: "In Mughal India, the 'Zamindari' right was NOT considered which of the following?", options: ["a saleable right", "hereditary", "ownership of land", "morgageable"], ans: 2, logic: "Zamindars were intermediaries who had the hereditary right to collect revenue, but they were not the absolute owners of the land; the land technically belonged to the state or the tiller." },
    { q: "The 'benefits received' principle of taxation to achieve optimality is based on?", options: ["Marginal benefit received", "Total benefit received", "Average benefit received", "Ability to pay for the benefit"], ans: 0, logic: "This principle suggests that individuals should be taxed in proportion to the marginal benefits they receive from public spending, mirroring a market price." },
    { q: "Paper currency first started in India in which year?", options: ["1861", "1542", "1601", "1880"], ans: 0, logic: "The Paper Currency Act of 1861 gave the Government of India the monopoly on issuing notes, ending the era of private bank notes." },
    { q: "Heavy clay soils that show significant expansion (wet) and contraction (dry) are called?", options: ["aridsols", "vertisols", "histosols", "andisols"], ans: 1, logic: "Vertisols are clay-rich soils that shrink and swell dramatically with moisture changes, often creating deep cracks during dry seasons." },
    { q: "Lance Armstrong, a sportsperson of international repute, belongs to which country?", options: ["USA", "Ukraine", "Spain", "Brazil"], ans: 0, logic: "Lance Armstrong is an American former professional road racing cyclist, famous for his Seven Tour de France titles (later stripped)." },
    { q: "Why is sugar production growing faster in South India than in North India?", options: ["I and II", "I, II and III", "I, III and IV", "I, II and IV"], ans: 3, logic: "The South offers higher yield per acre, higher sucrose content due to the tropical climate, and a longer crushing period compared to the North." },
    { q: "When was the first passenger elevator built?", options: ["1743", "1739", "1760", "1785"], ans: 0, logic: "The 'Flying Chair' was built for King Louis XV at the Palace of Versailles in 1743 so he could visit his mistress on the floor above." },
    { q: "Who has scored the most Test hundreds in cricket history?", options: ["Steve Waugh", "Sachin Tendulkar", "Shane Warne", "Sunil Gavaskar"], ans: 1, logic: "Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test centuries, with 51 hundreds in 200 matches." },

    { q: "The first metal used by man was?", options: ["iron", "copper", "gold", "bronze"], ans: 1, logic: "Copper was the first metal used by humans (around 8000 BC) because it could be found in a relatively pure state in nature." },
    { q: "If tuning fork A is higher frequency than B, and B is loaded with wax, the beat frequency will?", options: ["increase", "decrease", "remain same", "become zero"], ans: 0, logic: "Loading B with wax decreases its frequency. Since B was already lower than A, the gap between them increases, thus increasing the number of beats." },
    { q: "The highest national award in India for art, literature, and science is?", options: ["Bharat Ratna", "Padma Awards", "Gallantry Awards", "None of the above"], ans: 0, logic: "Instituted in 1954, the Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, recognizing exceptional service of the highest order." },
    { q: "The plants typically grown in equatorial regions include?", options: ["wheat, barley, maize", "evergreen dense forests, rubber trees, groundnuts", "groundnuts, soyabeans, potatoes", "evergreen coniferous forests, oats, cocoa"], ans: 1, logic: "Equatorial regions are characterized by high heat and rainfall, supporting dense rainforests and commercial crops like rubber." },
    { q: "Short-term variations of the atmosphere (minutes to months) are called?", options: ["climate", "weather", "temperature", "humidity"], ans: 1, logic: "Weather describes the short-term state of the atmosphere, whereas climate refers to the long-term average (usually 30 years)." },
    { q: "The 'Global 500' awards are given for outstanding achievement in which field?", options: ["Campaign against AIDS", "Population control", "Protection of environment", "Elimination of illiteracy"], ans: 2, logic: "Launched by the UNEP in 1987, these awards recognize individuals and organizations for environmental protection." },
