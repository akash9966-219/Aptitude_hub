Fleeting but spectacular sights snapped into and out of view, the snow, the shower of debris, the moon, looming close and big, the dazzling sunshine for once unfiltered by layers of air. \n\nThe last twelve hours before re-entry were particular bone-chilling. During this period, I had to go up in to command module. Even after the fiery re-entry splashing down in 81° water in south pacific, we could still see our frosty breath inside the command module.",

It seemed to me that it would be murder to shoot him. I had never shot an elephant and never wanted to. (Somehow it always seems worse to kill large animal.) \n\nBesides, there was the beast's owner to be considered. But I had got to act quickly. I turned to some experienced-looking Burmans who had been there when we arrived, and asked them how the elephants had been behaving. They all said the same thing; he took no notice of you if you left him alone, but he might charge if you went too close to him.",

In it, he found himself in a land where small slug-like animals with slimy tentacles lived on people's bodies. The people tolerated the loathsome creatures because after many years they grew into elephants which then became the nation's system of transport, carrying everyone wherever he wanted to go. \n\nHarold suddenly realised that he himself was covered with these things, and he woke up screaming. In a vivid sequence of pictures this dream dramatised for Harold what he had never been able to put in to words; he saw himself as letting society feed on his body in his early years so that it would carry him when he retired.

With lionesses busy hunting, the males function as guard for the cubs, protecting them particularly from hyenas.",

Our genuine goodwill and good intentions are often brought to nothing, because we expect other people to be like us.",

If an assessment is made of time they spent in gossiping, drinking tea, eating 'pan' and smoking cigarettes, it will be shocking to know that the time devoted to actual work is negligible. \n\nThe problem is the standard which the leadership in administration sets for the staff. The administration set up remains week mainly because the employees do not have the right example to follow and they are more concerned about being in the good books of the bosses than doing work.",

Again, different classes of people use different vocabularies, and the ordinary speech of an educated may strike an uneducated listener as pompous. Thus speech is not a gift to use lightly without thought, but one which demands careful handling.",

They compete for resource of the organisation, for example finance to expand their own departments, for career advancement and for power to control the activities of others. \n\nAs a result, policy decisions may serve the ends of political and career systems rather than those of the concern. These preoccupations sometimes prevent the emergence of organic systems. Many senior managers had little knowledge of technicality and possibilities of new developments.
